What is this purpose of this Git repository?
- This Git repository shows all of my work on labs and assignment for Comp20: Web Programming 

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
- My favorite assignment was the 2048 game server. I thought it was really fun to go on a self-learning/exploratory-learning exercise to learn about how to use Heroku. I also really enjoyed "tinkering". This assignment was all about exploring a real-world game that people play and figuring out how to modify the existing code. I also liked being able to play the game, type in my username, then immediately see my score show up on a gamecenter. That was so cool!!

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
- I think I have grown a lot in my basic understanding of how the internet and world wide web work. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
- I gained a solid understanding of what happens when you press the enter key in a web browser: 
  parse URL -> get IP address -> handshaking -> fill out request header -> send request -> process req -> send response -> process resp
- I also learned how to set up a web-server from scratch and how to make it use it with an existing web-app: 
  lab 7, 2048 game center, semester group project 
  
  Before this class I had absolutely no idea what a web server was or how it worked, I merely thought it was this mystical force that      magically made the internet work. Now I have a basic understanding of how a web-server can deliver content from other servers and/or store data and deliver that back in interesting ways. 

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
- I want to delve deeper into web programming in every aspect!! I want to learn more about backend and server code and really exploring 
  the dynamic web page possibilities that come with server side development. I also want to try out mobile development to make more interesting apps!
