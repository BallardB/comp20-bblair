README for 2048 Assignment 
Comp20 

This project modifies the 2048 app in the game_manager.js file to : 
- Prompt the user for a username once the game is finished 
- Sends that score data to a server which displays all of the 
  2048 scores which can be found here: 
  
  https://scoreboard2048.herokuapp.com/

I believe every aspect of this assignment has been correctly implemented 

I have discussed the assignment with the COMP20 TAs, HUGE thanks to them! 

I spent 4-5 hours completing this assignment.
