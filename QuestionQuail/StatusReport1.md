#Comments By Ming:
* "created a Heroku app for our project" => pardon my ignorance, what's the name of the app?
* "determining the order of priority for implementing different features" --go with the most important ones and the simplest.  Quick and easy wins are good and uplifting.
* "figuring out format of random code" => is QR an option?
* Don't get bogged down on the technology as that will change all the time.
